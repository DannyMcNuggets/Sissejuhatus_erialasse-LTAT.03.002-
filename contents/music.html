<p class="page_text">Jon Hopkins' Music for Psychedelic Therapy is a deeply immersive album crafted to accompany inner journeys and therapeutic experiences. Unlike his previous, more rhythm-driven work, this album is ambient, meditative, and free of beats, focusing on creating an expansive and reflective soundscape. Inspired by both natural sounds and ethereal synths, the music flows seamlessly across tracks, guiding listeners through states of calm introspection and transcendence. Hopkins collaborated with field recordist Mendel Kaelen and incorporates sounds from Ecuadorâ€™s Tayos Caves, which add an organic and grounding layer to the experience. This album is designed as a journey of healing and self-discovery, intended to be listened to in one continuous session.</p>
